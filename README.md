DISCLAIMER: 
I am not a coder.
This script was made with the good-old "quick and dirty" way of programming.
I may (and most probably will) not work on some occasion. It has been only partially tested.
It may also cause some security breach. 
If you notice something, please open a github ticket.

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU LOOSE MINING TIME, PROFIT OPPORTUNITY, COINS, SLEEP, VIRGINITY OR WHATEVER BECAUSE OF THIS SCRIPT. 


This script is designed for people mining with MiningPoolHub and HiveOS. It gives you the opportunity to switch automatically to the most profitable alorithm for your rig.
At this stage, this script is able to control only one of your rig, but it could be easily improved to control a whole farm.

More details in the comments of the script itself !
